# Stripe2qif: web

Very minimal web app for downloading Stripe balance-affecting transactions as QIF, primarily so that it can be treated as bank account in [FreeAgent](http://freagent.com).

It is a wrapper for the command line tool (written in Elixir) [here](https://github.com/paulanthonywilson/stripe2qif).

## Deployed

On Heroku, at https://stripe2qif.herokuapp.com.


## Elixir Dynamo



This is a project built with Elixir that uses [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) to serve web requests.
